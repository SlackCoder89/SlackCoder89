## Description
JAR hell is a term used to describe all the various ways in which the classloading process can end up not working.
- Two different versions of a library are on the class path. The JVM will load classes from one or the other version. But the behavior will be unpredictable.
- Multiple libraries or applications require different versions of library *foo*. If versions of library *foo* use the same class names, there is no way to load the versions of library *foo* with the same class loader.

## Fix
We can use dependencies management tool like **Maven** to solve this problem.
- **Maven** can specify which version of which library will be used.
- **Maven** can detect dependency conflicts.
